Welcome to the **Slouch Detector** project! This application uses your computer's camera to detect if you are slouching and reminds you to sit up straight sending you a notification.

It consists of two parts:
1.  **Flutter App**: The user interface (Desktop App).
2.  **Python Backend**: The logic that analyzes your posture using MediaPipe.
